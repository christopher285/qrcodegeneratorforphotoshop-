# qrcodegeneratorforphotoshop-
This is a qr code generator for photoshop run the script an you get a qr code ready to use!

Download the jsx and do file open scripts browse and run.

The file generates the qr code ready for use an puts it in a new tab in index colour so you might have to change the color to rgb or cmyk.

I had fun making this little plugin, i hope you find it useful too.
